                <p>Mohanlal Viswanathan Nair (born 21 May 1960), known mononymously as Mohanlal, is an Indian actor,
                    film
                    producer, playback singer, television host and film distributor who predominantly works in
                    Malayalam
                    cinema
                    besides also having sporadically appeared in Tamil, Hindi, Telugu and Kannada-language
                    films.[1][2][3]
                    Mohanlal has a prolific career spanning over four decades, during which he has acted in more
                    than 400
                    films.[2][4] Mohanlal's contributions to the Malayalam cinema have been praised by his
                    contemporaries in
                    the
                    Indian film industry.[5][6][7] The Government of India honoured him with Padma Shri in 2001,[8]
                    and
                    Padma
                    Bhushan in 2019, India's fourth and third highest civilian honours,[9] for his contributions to
                    Indian
                    cinema. In 2009, he became the first actor in India to be awarded the honorary rank of

                    colonel in
                    the Territorial Army.</p>

                for dubbing artists at KINFRA Film and Video Park, Trivandrum. The company's management was later taken
                over by Sohan Roy of Aries Group, which has now been renamed as Aries Vismayas Max. Mohanlal continues
                to be its brand ambassador. He has produced films under the production house Pranavam Arts
                International.[139]

                He owns restaurants in India and overseas, including a chain in Dubai called Mohanlal's Tastebuds,
                established in 2002, and a spices, pickles, condiments, and curry powder brand with the same name
                launched in February 2004 in the Middle East. From 2007, the Eastern Group owns the majority stake in
                the brand.[140] In 2006, he opened a seafood restaurant named The Harbour Market in Bangalore,[141] and
                a hotel named Travancore Court in Ernakulam.[142] His other business ventures include Uniroyal Marine
                Exports Limited â€“ a Kozhikode-based seafood export company, where he is a non-executive director since
                1992.[143] He is the co-founder, partner and chairman of Jose Thomas Performing Arts Centre (JTPac) in
                Thrippunithura, Kochi, an arts centre for performing arts and music established in 2009.[144] He is an
                independent director of Clenergen India Private Limited, a company for production and supply of biomass
                feedstock for biomass gasification.[145]

                In 2009, Mohanlal, along with Priyadarshan, tried to bid for an Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket team
                based in Kochi; they withdrew the bid on failing to source enough funds after a change in rules was
                introduced.[122][146] Mohanlal was the captain of the Kerala Strikers team in the Celebrity Cricket
                League (CCL) held in 2012 and 2013.</p>
